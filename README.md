# Then We Win (Monorepo)
An OpenSource, enterprise-grade Vue.js, Quasar, Strapi and Kubernetes based platform for social change.


## Getting started
You will need:

* A device to code on (even a potatoPC will work)
* Git
* Node.js
* Something to code with (VS Code recommended)

### Installing

```
cd front
npm i
```

### Running

```
npm run dev
```

### Building

```
npm run build
```
Built files will be placed in the ```/dist``` folder, and in "spa" for a Single Page App build.

> Note: Running the build files must be done on the root of a web server (you can change this with some config)

### Comming Soon
* We will be adding Strapi to the /platform folder.
* To develop services locally, we will use SQLLite.
* You'll also be able to develop using our DEV environment.
* Automatic deployments.
